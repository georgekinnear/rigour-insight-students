study1,rigour,1077,I would check that all cases had been considered and that all of the steps in the proof were correct. This is obviously easiest when the proof is laid out logically and neatly. 
study1,rigour,15,"A proof is rigorous if it follows a logical order, has no gaps, and demonstrates what is stated in the claim. It should cover all possibilities in case there are more than one, in the specific context. The proof should also be clear enough to understand it easily."
study1,rigour,269,When it contains no logical gap.
study1,rigour,6376,If it does not leave any gap between the premises and the conclusions. 
study1,rigour,48,"If there are no mistakes I can spot and I can understand it I will assume it is rigorous. I have no where near enough knowledge about maths or proofs of any kind at all to have any sort of authority to decide if a proof is rigorous or not, 99 times out of 100 I don't understand the proofs in the notes and I just assume they are okay."
study1,rigour,683,"Used only axiom as a known condition.
Make logical sense.

Well-formed and with comments/detailed explanation.

Also been proof by a large amount of specialists."
study1,rigour,983,No logical gaps. Easier to read if chain of implications are written in order.
study1,rigour,1251,"If a proof is heavy on the algebra and explains all of its claims/statements thoroughly, or at least points you to a resource that justifies them. Proofs that make use of pictures/diagrams I find usually a lot more intuitive but even if I can't think of a flaw in the proof, it still would not seem (as) rigorous."
study1,rigour,753,"A proof is rigorous if it is a correct, fully explained, logical pathway based on a clear set of assumptions, which are themselves either standard or explicitly given."
study1,rigour,3103,"By considering any counter examples that are not true due to the proof not being rigorous. 

If the argument doesn't flow well, or has no structure it may imply the proof is omitting some steps. 

If every step is justified."
study1,rigour,94,"I would decide if a proof is rigorous if it follows definitions and theorems to reach its conclusion, with no obvious gaps and each conclusion in the proof giving full validity to following conclusions."
study1,rigour,74,Rigorous proof would be explained clearly and simply with no excessive details or jumps to conclusions. It would offer a logical argument that the reader can follow. It would also not make any unnecessary assumptions and be as all encompassing as possible. 
study1,rigour,1553,"To decide whether a proof is rigorous, we need to carefully check each step of the proof and consider whether the former steps could be deduced into the latter ones, to make sure that each step is logically clear. A rigorous proof should demonstrate the given claims or propositions under any required constraints. "
study1,rigour,577,"Firstly, it would have to contain no errors or unproven assumptions. It would also need to be a complete set of logical statements with no bits left to intuition or guessing. I might also expect it to follow the established notation conventions. I tend to find proofs that appeal to algebra over geometry more rigorous."
study1,rigour,537,"A rigorous proof makes no non-trivial logical jumps and does not allow for any loss of generality relative to the proposition. In addition, the proof should be clear and unambiguous in all steps."
study1,rigour,169,The steps follow on from the previous. And is right in all the conditions stated
study1,rigour,1459,A proof is rigorous if a clear assumption is made and then logical statements follow in a logical order with a logical conclusion. A rigorous proof must have no gaps.
study1,rigour,1301,"What I would look for:
 - no gaps in logical proceedings

 - connecting sentences short and efficient"
study1,rigour,625,A good proof should be well organised and show each step clearly. 
study1,rigour,857,"I would say a proof is rigorous when the steps are shown clearly and done so precisely. Stating definitions in proofs is important to be rigorous, however should be concise and not contain information that isn't fundamental to the proof. "
study1,rigour,1466,Has no gaps and no leaps to conclusions. Is no longer than it needs to be and the theorems and definitions used are clearly available.
study1,rigour,524,I would first ensure that I understand the claim and try to form my own conclusion of what the proof/answer shall be to ensure that the proof given provides the right answer. I would then read the proof and  decide if the  method of proof  that the writer has a suitable / good  choice or not. Next I would actively read the proof and try to find any mistakes or ommissions that I feel are a significant error. 
study1,rigour,2719,It is clear to the reader and does not lack any logical steps.
study1,rigour,104,"There is no logical gap between steps.
All the sentences are well formed with aid of maths notations.

Overall the structure is clear."
study1,rigour,17,"I think a proof would be considered rigorous if it covers each aspect of the statement, and proves it in such a way that it cannot be contradicted."
study1,rigour,624,"Proof starts with a previous definition or theorem and builds/adapts it with each line logically following on from the previous.

Each line needs justification, as to why it is possible and relevant.

Proofs that fall into a strict category such as: ""proof by induction"", ""proof by counterexample"" tend to be more formulaic and easier to see if the proof is rigorous."
study1,rigour,1736,Each step follows logically from the previous one with clear reasoning. There are no gaps in the argument. Only fundamental axioms are assumed and are stated where necessary.
study1,rigour,651,"A rigorous proof is one that makes it very clear what one is assuming to be true, what the definitions being used are, and how exactly the result is derived using such. In other words, it is a proof that covers all its bases and justifies all the steps within! "
study1,rigour,78,"A proof is rigorous if it defines all the variables or notation needed within the proof. It is also rigorous if it follows a logical argument, and there are no gaps i.e. covers all the possible ""cases"". "
study1,rigour,45, The axioms used in the proof are accurate and correct. There are no gaps between steps and the logic is clear throughout the proof. 
study1,rigour,425,"A mathematical proof needs three parts: language, deduction system and axiom. Rigorous mathematical proof should be the result of the deduction and proof of axioms and derived theorems step by step with a clear logic. If the axiom or theorem has a scope of application, the conclusion should only be in this scope."
study1,rigour,6860,"I think a proof is rigorous should be drived from axioms or theorms.  If there two have a scope of application, the conclusion we prove should only in this scope. 
Furthermore, every steps in our proof we prove should be true."
study1,rigour,5010,"A proof is rigorous when it has no holes or unjustified shortcuts in logic, does not contradict earlier statements (unless on purpose), covers all possible cases when the proof is intended to be valid, and leaves the reader convinced in the truth of the statement being proved."
study1,insight,127,A proof would give me insight if it is clear and concise. All the terms and processes should be well defined. Each step should be shown with no gaps in the proof.  
study1,insight,2715,"The theorem is clearly stated to start. Then the working in the proof step by step and easy to follow, without the omission of any parts. The proof should include reasoning for steps which are not explicitly obvious."
study1,insight,1153,"- If the steps are logical and follow a good structure.

- Any previous results required for the proof are either well cited or maybe even stated in the proof.

- If the proof is easily reproducible

- If the claim being proved is used in arithmetic calculations/in computational work then the method of the proof could maybe give an insight into how such computation would be carried out"
study1,insight,2850,"A proof gives me insight if it clearly follows a logical story which highlighting any interesting remarks or points which make the argument more natural. For long proofs, outlines/summaries of the line of argument can be very useful."
study1,insight,1104,"After reading a proof, there should be no doubt at all that the claim is true. A proof is a clear argument for a case, that covers every option. That is to say a proof either says why the claim is true in all cases, or why the claim has to be true by disproving all other cases."
study1,insight,2046,"The statement to proof must be clearly stated and the proof should have a clear logical progression.

Initially, results used in the later part of the proof should be derived. This does not refer to whole theorems but rather stressing the important properties of the environment the proof/ theorem takes place in. "
study1,insight,248,I would decide if a proof gives me insight depending on whether the steps of the proof were clear and if so if they have proven all cases. I.e. iff would have to prove both sides in order for it to make sense. I would also base it depending on the additional explanations and notes to the written mathematical formulae.
study1,insight,605,"The proof has to be correct, use language of an appropriate level, but also not be unnecessarily convoluted. A mixture of mathematical expressions and plain text would be appreciated (a proof written only using symbols is hard to read)."
study1,insight,22,Whether I can understand each step or not. It has to follow logically onwards from the previous step. Ideally it would be applicable and useful in other fields.
study1,insight,544,A proof should be clearly structured and easy to follow. It should be concise and hold enough detail as appropriate for the level of education of the reader.
study1,insight,2753,"The proof would use proper language and include a reference to any notation not commonly used. The proof may contain a clear structure, e.g. a claim at the beginning or a conclusion at the end. The theorem or definition used in the proof should be stated, and reference if it is necessary."
study1,insight,1634,"If I can read it and understand where I have started and what I have ended up with, and if they are clearly formatted to prove what was initially set out in the first sentence. Explaining every step as if I were a three year old being taught this, by very logically writing down everything and not allowing the reader to assume anything. "
study1,insight,539,A proof gives me insight primarily if it is easy to understand and all of the steps taken are explained clearly. Notation should also be consistent and defined properly. 
study1,insight,64,"* Defines all the variables used at the beginning. 
	* Has a nice structure, easy to follow, and a concluding statement.
	* References formulas, theorems, papers to make it more credible."
study1,insight,562,I will ask myself. Which one is correct? Which one is more clear? Which one is easier to understand?
study1,insight,909,"Clarity and use of language is crucial to an effective proof, to emphasize the key steps and avoid the proof reducing to an extended series of ""...thus, ..., therefore, ..., thus..."" statements which leave the reader pondering where the magic happened. Additionally, an insightful proof should state clearly the methodology and tools used to tackle the problem, e.g. if proof by contradiction or induction is used."
study1,insight,512,"First of all, a good proof should include a generalized idea as simple as you can, one sentence will be the best. Secondly, it should include a connection with other results pr theorems and how we can distinguish between one another. Last but not least, one can include the application of the proof: how we can use the theorem to prove another lemma or solve a related mathematical problem."
study1,insight,2400,A proof gives you insight if it is clear and can convince you that what they are trying to prove is true.
study1,insight,560,"If the proof has a clear claim and conclusion and each step is easy to follow, the proof becomes more convincing. If there are steps missing or assumptions not explained, the logical leaps to get from the claim to the conclusion reduce how ""valid"" I would consider the proof."
study1,insight,572,"The proof should be precise and each step in the proof should make sense without having to read over it many times to understand how one step follows from another. If any notation is introduced that is not standard for that level, then it should be explained well. Normally a more direct argument to prove the statement is more helpful than very abstract or situational proofs."
study1,insight,831,"A proof gives insight if it has a clear 'narrative'. This means

A) The method of proof could be described in an informal manner to another mathematician, who could then recreate it by filling in the formal details.

B) The purpose of each step of the proof (i.e. the problem it is solving) is clear, and it is clear how each step relates to the steps before and after it.

This ensures that the proof gives some insight to the reader that is not present in the theorem itself. This insight could then be used to solve similar problems."
study1,insight,829,"It must be elegant, have a logical flow that is easy to follow, without any gaps, and any ""clearly this is true"" statements when it's not clear. "
study1,insight,1220,"A proof should be easy to follow, and explained clearly step-by-step. 

A proof gives me insight when it allows me to understand why a certain proving method is used. "
study1,insight,1270,"I think that a proof gives insight if:

(1) Its line of argument is well explained and well written.

(2) The less obvious axioms or theorems used in the proof are referenced or proved within the proof. If a more obscure result is used without any explanation this can be confusing."
study1,insight,55,If a proof is easy to follow and each step is well explained with a reason why each step is justified (i.e. with theorems).
study1,insight,525,If the transition between each step can be clearly seen. If a person is using a theorem in their proof citing or describing what it is and not taking it as assumed knowledge. Providing a geometric interpretation alongside the rigorous proof to show a clear and full understanding where possible.
study1,insight,3126,If I can follow each step with clear understanding. A mixture of words and mathematical symbols helps; I find it difficult to understand a proof if there is no written explanation of what is happening.
study1,insight,46,Proofs can provide new ways to think about problems and how to solve them. They can also show why proving a certain theorem or claim might be helpful and they can help develop mathematical thinking. 
study1,insight,7851,"I would decide if a proof gives me insight by how clearly the steps to get from the givens to the result are explained. I think it is important that there isn't room for ambiguity in the proof so that I, as the reader, only need to worry about my own ability to understand the mathematics, rather than trying to deduce the logic employed by the author."
study1,insight,2920,"I would decide if while reading it (not necessarily the first time) I get that ""Aha!"" moment when I realise the deeper connection underlying the theorem or result. If there are any particularly unintuitive steps which can be justified or explained (not just: ""by the power of hindsight/trial and error, we do X"") this would also count as it helps me develop the skills to then go away and write proofs by myself -- in that field or even in a completely different one."
study1,insight,3705,Clear and concise steps that lead to the conclusion and proving all possible scenarios that apply to the proof. Proof states all of the results from other Theorems etc. that are used.
study1,insight,1071,A proof gives me insight if it is clearly displayed and easy to follow. I find it much easier to follow a proof if there isn't too much unnecessary notation introduced. The structure to a proof is very important as this means everything is explained in the correct order making it as clear as possible.
study2,rigour,7438,"For a proof to be rigorous, it needs to be detailed enough so that the person reading the proof is easily able to follow it. This includes presenting definitions and assumptions in a clear manner and including transition phrases that clearly specify the step you are taking."
study2,rigour,5584,"The proof should be completely general (expressed in terms of parameters such as n, k etc. and thus apply to all possible instances, e.g. all real numbers or all integers. The proof should of course be mathematically correct and should go into sufficient detail for its purpose/anticipated reader(s). Chiefly, the proof should prove no more or less than precisely what it sets out to prove."
study2,rigour,5595,"A proof is rigorous if and only if, starting with a set of premises which we deem to be axiomatically true (or non-axiomatic well-established derivations thereof built on papers upon papers utilising similar rigurous methods), we can derive a true conclusion by clearly applying said premises, one or more at a time, in a manner that goes beyond all reasonable doubt (in the way that us humans perceive the world)."
study2,rigour,5308,A proof which can be called rigorous proof must explain explicitly at everywhere. It should justify which theorems or collaries it have used.
study2,rigour,5267,The proof must follow the structure which includes a starting sentence and a concluding sentence. The proof must contain details that are relevant and is fluent and clear. 
study2,rigour,6034,If all cases are covered by the proof it is rigorous!
study2,rigour,5978,"Each step of the proof is clear and valid, showing how the conclusion was coherently found."
study2,rigour,5528,If a proof is rigorous then it clearly demonstrates the truth of the statement through clear steps. Making sure each claim is justified. 
study2,rigour,6195,"1. Base case, let's prove that P(1)

left: sum(2*k-1,k,1,1)=2*1-1=1

right: n^2=1^2=1

so, it's true for P(1)

2. Induction step: Assume that P(n) is true and consider,

sum(2*k-1,k,1,n+1)=sum(2*k-1,k,1,n)+(2*(n+1)-1)

                              =n^2+(2*n+1)

                              =(n+1)^2

where we used the statement P(n) to replace sum(2*k-1,k,1,n) with (n+1)^2

Hence sum(2*k-1,k,1,n+1)=(n+1)^2 which proves that P(n)=>P(n+1) is true

Since P(1),P(n)=>P(n+1) it follows that P(n) is true for all n belongs to N by the principle of mathematical induction."
study2,rigour,5199,"For a proof to be rigorous it should clearly state what question they are trying to answer and then state their claim for the question. They should then begin from the start and then using clearly explained logical steps, they should eventually arrive at a conclusion. For it to be rigorous,  there should be no edge cases left unexplained and there should be no ambiguity surrounding the validity of any of the logical steps "
study2,rigour,6017,"Have a clear claim and essential sentence to lead reader through the proof.

Have correct logical step to show the result.

Have a clear conclusion."
study2,rigour,5212,"For a proof to be rigorous It must be detailed enough such that nothing can be misconstrued while reading through it, but also not overly complex as to confuse the reader with terms and notation that would be unfamiliar to them. There is a fine balance between these two, however the priority should be understandability from the reader. If a proof is overly complex, then there is no point in reading through the proof, as the reader would not be able to understand it. However, if a proof were to be simplified, the reader could use the proof as a springboard to begin to understand the true proof, working off of what they had learned with the simplified, and slowly applying more complex topics and concepts."
study2,rigour,6016,It is very difficult to write out a good and standard proof .
study2,rigour,6821,"A rigorous proof is one which is self-contained (meaning all the information you need is in the proof), considers all possibilities (such as the occasional division by zero or something of the sort) and written in such a way that it is easy to read and understand"
study2,rigour,6046,"To explain each step in enough detail for the reader to understand. This depends on the context of the proof. A proof of the same thing for an A level student is going to have more detail than a proof of the same thing to a first year student, simply because the first year student probably knows more maths"
study2,rigour,5549,"For a proof to be rigorous, it should be clear and hold up when inspected closely."
study2,rigour,5279,"Covers all bases and any exceptions are considered, leaving no room for doubt that the stated is always correct."
study2,rigour,5919,no
study2,rigour,6051,"Must either use valid logic to infer an already proven theorem can be used to prove it, or use the absolute fundamental axioms and well reasoned logic to infer that something is true."
study2,rigour,5738,A rigorous proof should be logically valid. And it should include all the possible cases.
study2,rigour,5731,"In my opinion, a rigorous proof is a proof that can explain clearly the series of axioms, statements and hypothesis, and their connections that led to the theorem or statement that we want to prove. The proof needs to detailed but simple enough so that the reader can clearly see the connections between the axioms, statements and hypothesis. The connections also need to be strong and free from any contradictions that may arise."
study2,rigour,5333,If every small piece of reasoning in a proof is logically sound and they combine logically to produce the desired conclusion.
study2,rigour,5506,proof is considered to be rigorous if it provides a lot of details. it should be very clear so that everyone can understand.

study2,rigour,6031,"Clearly explained. It is easy to follow what has been assumed, defined etc. Covers all cases if there are more than 1 case."
study2,rigour,5990,A proof is rigorous if I can show every step and the conclusion follows without any gaps from the premises.
study2,rigour,5926,To prove something completely using axioms or other theorems that can be proven using axioms.

study2,rigour,5316,"A proof is rigorous when the objective is clearly stated, the theorems and lemmeas used are mentioned specifically, and every inference follows logically from the next. "
study2,rigour,5807,"The proof must not be easily subject to questioning of bold assumptions, that ought to have been proved.

The proof must be explicit in its logic, showing clear implications rather than vague connections.

Must proof the statement exactly."
study2,rigour,7757,"Each step follows logically from the previous step such that at no point can rational doubt of the logical inferences be asserted. A rigorous proof takes a starting statement, and with the least possible assumptions, reaches a conclusion that must be considered true."
study2,rigour,6143,"The proof should cover all cases that are possible. It should be clearly written and unambiguous so that the proof can be followed by the reader. There should be no gaps that should be included for a proof of that level, but every detail need not be proved as long as they are known to be true. An if and only if proof should be proved by assuming the first statement and concluding the second statement and then assuming the second statement to conclude the first, or by using another method that maintains the equivalency. "
study2,rigour,6048,"For a proof to be rigorous, it should eliminate all possibility of vagueness or ambiguity. It should cover all possible cases, so that the theorem does not simply apply to a specific value or expression. All variables used should be noted and expressed (i.e. do they belong to the reals, rationals etc)."
study2,rigour,5909,There are no gaps or flaws in the logic and we can assert with certainty that the proof is correct

study2,rigour,5426,A rigorous proof is a proof which is proven thoroughly and carefully
study2,rigour,5859,It means that you demonstrate that the asserted outcome arises from the premise through an unbroken chain of steps each of which is logically clear. This means considering the potential logical gaps in each step and being able to demonstrate this in a convincing way.

study2,rigour,5757,A rigorous proof is a proof that can be seen to be valid by means of a valid proof-checking algorithm. 
study2,rigour,5172,"A proof is a set of small steps leading to a conclusion. In order for a proof to be considered rigorous, the steps should be axioms, or theorems derived from axioms."
study2,insight,6364,a good proof must be concise and descriptive. it must include a clarative statement followed by a detailed proof. if definitions are used then they must be named.
study2,insight,6424,"When we have a theorem and we want to prove it, we need to use our known knowledge, building relationships by using our logic so that we can explain to everyone with the proof processes to make them understand why the theorem is true."
study2,insight,6787,"A good proof should give a well structured and logically flowing argument. It should be clear and concise, and should guide the reader through the logic in a simple way without unnecessary jumping around or side-tracking.

study2,insight,6328,A rigorous proof describes and breaks down the makings of the theorem at the most fundamental level thus providing insight into why said theorem is true.
study2,insight,5839,"a proof give insight into why a theorem is true by a sequence of logical arguments which can establish the truth through the inference rules of a deductive system. I think it helps understanding of the theorem and where it comes from. In general, it helps the understanding of mathematics better. "
study2,insight,6939,"The proof uses logical and deductive reasoning to unequivocally validify a theorem. Using universally accepted axioms and quantifiers as a base for all proofs, all theorem's are verified through these and previously proven theorems, lemmas and corollaries. Through this you can follow each step of reasoning, which have complete justification to gain an insight into why a theorem is true."
study2,insight,6855,Using concepts that are already proved to show a new theorem is also true.
study2,insight,6348,"Proof shows how the theorem has developed. Therefore, the people can understand the essential parts of the theorem. "
study2,insight,5946,"The reasoning laid out in many proofs determines the proof of the theorem from a series of premises (often, the assumed knowledge of the reader). As each step in a proof should follow logically from the previous (or an already accepted theorem), then following these steps should lead to seeing how the theorem follows from that which is already known, and hence provides insight into why, given what we already know, we should accept the theorem as true. Arguably, a good proof does this in a way that is easy for the human mind to follow and thus build some degree of intuitiveness of the nature of the theorem, and why it is true. It can also connect mathematical concepts and ideas, thus giving insight into the structure of the subject being considered and mathematics in general. However, not all proofs do provide such insight; some proofs, such as proof by exhaustion of cases and zero knowledge proofs, provide little or no insight into why a theorem is true, despite assuring us that it is so. "

study2,insight,5603,It provides an intuitive explanation into the reasoning behind a concept
study2,insight,6696,The proof needs to show all of the possible ways in which the theorem being proved is true. The proof should build of previous theorems which are already known to be true. The proof explains all the different parts that make up the theorem and show they are true.

study2,simple,5345,Clear and concise. Being able to understand it without getting too confused.
study2,simple,5256,"For a proof to be simple, it should be concise but explanatory. It should need to be only read once to be understood. Each step in the proof should be easy to follow, that is easy to understand what step is being taken when that step is read, but not necessarily why it is being taken."
study2,simple,5589,"For a proof to be simple (assuming ""simple"" is meant to have positive connotations in this context), it should be well set out, straightforward, and easy for the reader to follow, avoiding straying into unnecessary tangents and generally being clear in proof.

""simple"" in a negative context would be a proof that misses steps/leaves out key details and leaves the reader wondering how they have gotten from one point to another."
study2,simple,5944,"In my view, for a proof to be simple, it means that it is easy to follow for a learning mathematician/ someone who is moderately well read in mathematics. 

For it to be simple would suggest that it is only marginally more difficult than a trivial case, so would require little explanation - as long as that explanation is clear. "

study2,simple,5552," Base case, let's prove that P(1)

left: sum(2*k-1,k,1,1)=2*1-1=1

right: n^2=1^2=1

so, it's true for P(1)

2. Induction step: Assume that P(n) is true and consider,

sum(2*k-1,k,1,n+1)=sum(2*k-1,k,1,n)+(2*(n+1)-1)

                              =n^2+(2*n+1)

                              =(n+1)^2

where we used the statement P(n) to replace sum(2*k-1,k,1,n) with (n+1)^2

Hence sum(2*k-1,k,1,n+1)=(n+1)^2 which proves that P(n)=>P(n+1) is true

Since P(1),P(n)=>P(n+1) it follows that P(n) is true for all n belongs to N by the principle of mathematical induction."
